## v1.1.0

In this small update, only one, but exciting, change was made. This was getting weather data!

-   The `getWeather` method came, which retrieved the weather for any location.
-   Along with `getWeather`, `changeWeatherData` also came, so that your data from the weather could be reformatted.

## v1.0.5

This version was basically the first version, since it was the version where the base methods and classes came.

-   The `randomGreeting` method, which shows a random greeting to the user (if they are signed in).
-   The `BasicSearch` class. This, at the time, had `formatQuery` and `search`. As of version 1.1.5, `search` is deprecated.
-   The `User` class had come, with many methods. These could be used for managing the user.

## v1.0.0

This version is the starting version. It featured only starting files, some which were removed later without a trace.

-   `websiteVersion` and `version`.
-   The `returnVersions` method, which was removed in version 1.0.5.
